SDM is a very simple Display Manager entirely written in bash.

To use it follow the steps below:

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Move sdm to a place of your choice (This might be somewhere in your $PATH or somewhere else - This is up to you)
3. Put the sample .sdmrc into your home directory and edit it according to your needs
   (One DE/WM per line)
4. Go to a Linux console and execute sdm
5. Enjoy :)

Important: Your .xinitrc should not contain a exec command. This will be handled from SDM.
(SDM executes the selected WM/DE and takes the .xinitrc into account)

For example:

.xinitrc:
setxkbmap us &
xset s off &

.sdmrc:
i3
dwm
bspwm

After executing SDM you can chose between the three WM's listed above.
