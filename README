SDM is a very simple Display Manager entirely written in bash.

To use it follow the steps below:

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Move sdm to a place of your choice (This might be somewhere in your $PATH or somewhere else - This is up to you)
3. Put the sample .sdmrc into your home directory and edit it according to your needs
   (One DE/WM per line)
4. Go to a Linux console and execute sdm
5. Enjoy :)
